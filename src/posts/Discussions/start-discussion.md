Any Group member can start a LORROS Discussion – it’s easy!

Just like an email, Discussions have:
* A subject *(subject line in an email)*
* Background of the Discussion *(the content in an email)*
* The option to add files to the Discussion

Unlike emails, **LORROS Discussions have end dates**. This encourages your group set goals and timelines and to insure that Discussions don't go on forever.

**To start a Discussion, simply:**
1. Click start a Discussion
2. Add a subject
3. Choose an end date *(can be changed at anytime during the discussion)*
4. Add the background and files *(if required)*
5. Click Submit - that's it!

An email will automatically be sent to all the members of your group.
