Any Group member can start a LORROS Discussion – it’s easy!

Just like an email, Discussions have:

* A subject _(subject line in an email)_
* Background of the Discussion _(the content in an email)_
* The option to add files to the Discussion

Unlike emails, **LORROS Discussions have end dates**. This encourages your group set goals and timelines and to insure that Discussions don't go on forever.

**To start a Discussion, simply:**

1. Click start a Discussion
2. Add a subject
3. Choose an end date _(can be changed at anytime during the discussion)_
4. Add the background and files _(if required)_
5. Click Submit - that's it!

An email will automatically be sent to all the members of your group.
